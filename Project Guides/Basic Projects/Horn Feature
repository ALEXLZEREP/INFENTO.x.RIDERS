# *Components Needed*
 -Arduino board
 -Speaker
 -Push button
 -Wires
 -Breadboard (if user is more comfortable with it)


# *Wiring Diagram* 
   Connect one leg of the push button to a digital pin (e.g., pin 2) on the Arduino.

   Connect the other leg of the push button to the ground (GND).

   Connect the positive terminal of the speaker to a PWM pin (e.g., pin 9) on the Arduino.

   Connect the negative terminal of the speaker to the ground (GND).

**(Change the pins if you feel. Specific pins are not needed, this guide has randomized pin numbers.
Please feel free to use whats better for you!)**


# *The code*

const int buttonPin = 2;    // Pin connected to the push button
const int speakerPin = 9;   // Pin connected to the speaker

void setup() {
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(speakerPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  int buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

  if (buttonState == HIGH) {
    tone(speakerPin, 1000); // Play a 1000 Hz tone
  } else {
    noTone(speakerPin);     // Stop the tone
  }
}
